Code developed by David Singh Arjona, for the purpose of the Project #2: Explore US Bikeshare Data, during the Data Analytics Fundamentals Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

Compilation time calculations were suppressed to make the code a little more efficient, since it's not really necessary.

Most of the code was written using the practice problems in the Project Tab, from the Udacity Classroom Platform.

Most of the methods used were obtained from a Pandas Cheat Sheet, available in: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf.

Inside the station_stats function, the most_frequent_combination variable was calculated using the methods proposed by the user BENY from the Stack Overflow public forums, available in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53037698/how-can-i-find-the-most-frequent-two-column-combination-in-a-dataframe-in-python.

The data_view function was defined through the feedback received after the first submittion.
